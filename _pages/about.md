We study interactions of human food and energy production with the atmosphere and biosphere through the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Modern intensified agriculture involves nitrogen fertilizer application and manure production that lead to substantial reactive nitrogen losses (NH3, N2O, NOx, NO3-) to the environment, leading to cascading damages to air and water quality, climate, and the health of human and ecosystems. Fossil fuel burning for energy emit greenhouse gas emissions and NOx, influencing both climate and air quality. To solve the challenge of fulfilling huamn demand for energy and food while maintaining environmental integrity, we combine multidisciplinary research methods (including atmospheric chemistry transport models, agronomic experiment data, economic model, risk-exposure functions, etc) to explore the technical opportunities and benefits for multiple environmental & health objctives.
